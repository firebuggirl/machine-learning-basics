# Machine Learning Workflow


  - Asking the right question

  - Preparing data

  - Selecting the right algorithm

  - Training the right model

  - Testing the model

  - 50-80% of ML is getting, cleaning, and organizing data

## Preparing data


    - Use Pandas to read in demo data

    - Use a function to identify correlated features

    - Clean data by removing the extraneous column of the correlated features

    - Mold data by changing the data types of columns into what we need

    - Check True/False value ratio

    - Discuss data rules

## Selecting your algorithm
