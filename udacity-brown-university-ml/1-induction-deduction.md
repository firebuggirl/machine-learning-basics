# Induction and Deduction

## `Supervised Learning` => `function approximation` => take training examples + function that generalizes beyond the data that you've seen

    - form of generalization => `inductive bias` is a problem

        - induction => Did the sun rise yesterday? yes, we know this to be true . Is it going to rise tomorrow?

    - `deduction` => going from a general rule to specific instances => deductive reasoning => a implies b

    - labels data well


## `Unsupervised Learning` => `description`

    - taking a set of data and figuring out how to divide it one way or another => there are no `labels`

    - cluster scores well

## `Reinformcement Learning` => learning from delayed reward

    - feedback may come from several steps after the decisions that you've already made

    - behavior scores well
