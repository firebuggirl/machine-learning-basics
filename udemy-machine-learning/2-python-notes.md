# For Python learners, summary of Object-oriented programming: classes & objects

## classes, objects and methods


  - A `class` is the model of `something we want to build`. For example, if we make a house construction plan that gathers the instructions on how to build a house, then this construction plan is the class.

  - An `object` is an `instance of the class`. So if we take that same example of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. A house (the object) that was built by following the instructions of the construction plan (the class).
And therefore there can be many objects of the same class, because we `can build many houses from the construction plan`.

  - A `method` is a `tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action`. So in this same example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if a guest is coming. A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto the object, takes some inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.


## PS: IMPORTANT NOTE. In the Python part of the next tutorial, ``‘NaN’`` has to be replaced by `‘np.nan’`. This is due to an update in the sklearn library
