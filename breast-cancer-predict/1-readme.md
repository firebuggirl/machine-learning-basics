##  Dataset has `569 instances`, or data, on `569 tumors` + `30 features` = such as `radius` of the tumor, `texture`, `smoothness`, and `area`

    - `label` => malignant vs benign

    - `useful attributes` => size, radius, + texture of the tumor


## Build + evaluate model w/ `Naive Bayes(NB)` algorithm
